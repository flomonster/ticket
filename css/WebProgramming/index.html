					<li>
						Damien Grisonnet
						<blockquote>
							I have already made 2-3 websites containing a lots of HTML and CSS code and just a bit of PHP and Javascript. <br> So this time I wanted to make a website without a lot of static content but with evolving content. <br> So as a consequence I teamed up with Bertrand and Arthur who were reliable.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Bertrand Ha
						<blockquote>
							I am the oldest of the group since I graduated from high school two years before them. <br>
							I have nonetheless already worked with both of them in group projects during the first 3 semesters in our school and it is with great pleasure that I'm working with them again for this project although it is the first time I have to use HTML and CSS as extensively.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Arthur Pamart
						<blockquote>
					  I am a fan of video games, which is why I'm in computer science. <br>Sport is also really important to me, I play handball and I jog. Finally, I love reading, whether it is novels, comic strips, or shorts.
